## Directions

   - Open a new window if you have another project, `File > New Window`
   - Choose `Clone Git Repository...` from the Start options OR Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you want to store the project (hint: use the command `cd [PATHNAME]`, and run the following command: `git clone [HTTPS_LINK_TO_REMOTE_REPO]`

   - Open the new cloned folder in VSCode
   - Write your code in the `index.html` and `index.css` files from the list of files on the left. If you don't see the files in the folder, choose the explorer which looks like pages in the upper part of the left navigation
   - **Make your edits!** 😎
   
## Submission

   - Type a message into the field at the top of the bar that opens
   - Choose the plus button that appears when you hover over changes; this prepares all of the changes you made to be packaged into a commit
   - Hit the commit button!
   - Hit that button again in order to send your commit from your local repository to the remote one (syncing the two repositories)
   - You're done!! 🎉🎉🎉
