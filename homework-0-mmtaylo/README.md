# CS+SG Fall 2024 Education Team Homework 0

## Introduction

In this homework assignment, you will be applying what you've learned by cloning your own repository before making a commit! 🤓

## Requirements
1. Clone this repository
2. Write your name on line 9 of `index.html` 👩🏾‍💻
3. Submit by making a commit 🥳

## Directions
1. **Clone this Repository**
   - Download VSCode if you don't have it downloaded already (see our installation guide!)
   - Open VSCode
   - Open a new window if you have another project, `File > New Window`
   - Choose `Clone Git Repository...` from the Start options OR Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you want to store the project (hint: use the command `cd [PATHNAME]`, and run the following command: `git clone [HTTPS_LINK_TO_REMOTE_REPO]`

   - Choose the plus button that appears when you hover over changes; this prepares all of the changes you made to be packaged into a commit
   - Hit the commit button!
   - Hit that button again in order to send your commit from your local repository to the remote one (syncing the two repositories)
   - You're done!! 🎉🎉🎉
